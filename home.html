            <p>
                Think bats are spooky? Think again! These little night flyers are nature's pest control experts
                — gobbling up thousands of bugs every night (yes, including mosquitoes!). Some bats also help flowers
                bloom and trees grow by pollinating plants and spreading seeds. Without bats, we'd have fewer bananas,
                mangoes, and even chocolate. Now that's a tragedy.

            <h3 id="section-title"><u>How Do Bats Get Hurt?</u></h3>
            <p>
                Despite their superpowers, bats have a lot to deal with. They can get injured when they:
                <ul>
                    <li>Crash into windows or cars (echolocation isn't foolproof!)</li>
                    <li>Get tangled in netting, fences, or even stringy decorations</li>
                    <li>Lose their homes to construction or tree cutting</li>
                    <li>Accidentally get poisoned by pesticides</li>
                    <li>Get disturbed while hibernating and burn up precious energy</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="home-page-body">
            <h3 id="section-title"><u>What Does a Bat Sanctuary Do?</u></h3>
            <p>
                Think of a sanctuary as a cozy bat hotel with a top-notch medical spa. When a bat is hurt or in trouble,
                a sanctuary steps in with:
                <ul>
                    <li>Bat-sized bandages and medical magic</li>
                    <li>Delicious bug buffets and fresh fruit smoothies</li>
                    <li>Safe spaces to hang out and recover</li>
                    <li>Training for release back into the wild (when possible)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Some bats become permanent residents and help teach humans how awesome bats really are.

                <li>Gently place it in a box with air holes and a soft towel inside. Gently</li>
                <li>Keep it calm and cozy. Quiet and warmth are key!</li>
